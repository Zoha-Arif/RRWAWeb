<p class="blog-text1">The East Coast Greenway is a city-to-city route that runs from Key West, Florida to the Canadian border in Calais, Maine. The route traverses the Rahway River watershed in Middlesex and Union counties, on the way from New Brunswick to Elizabeth. 
The RRWA Olmsted Parks committee is exploring routes to connect the East Coast Greenway with other trail networks in the watershed, and recently presented a slide show at the NJ Land Conservation Conference: The Future of Land Conservation, The Next 20 Years. The group proposed several possible routes for suburban greenways along the Rahway River to connect trails in Lenape Park and Black Brook Park with the trail network in South Mountain Reservation. Crossing routes 22 and 78 present majors challenges, but pedestrian overpasses in other greenways along these routes have successfully met this challenge. 
The photo essay for the presentation can be found at the link below. See how many of these places along the Rahway River you can recognize! Contact RRWA President Marian Glenn at Marian.Glenn@shu.edu for further information.

<p class="blog-text1">Fanwood's new rain garden (rear) at Borough Hall was opened Tuesday, May 19, in a short ceremony as Mayor Colleen Mahr and 10-year-old Taylor Klein cut a yellow ribbon with clippers to make it official.

Klein, a student at Park Middle School and winner of the recent Fanwood Earth Day poster contest, also unveiled the rain barrel she decorated that will be installed at Borough Hall.

The rain garden is along the driveway at Borough Hall and catches rain runoff from the drive and parking areas near the front entrance. It was designed and planted by Margaret Chowdhury and Phyllis Sandrock of the Fanwood Environmental Commission. Funding for the garden was provided by the Rahway River Watershed Association using a grant from the Watershed Institute.

In the photo, Mahr and Klein cut the ribbon to open the rain garden. Dave Schwartzberg, left, Sandy Redder, Sandrock and Chowdhury, right, of the Environmental Commission are joined by Bob Weldon of Weldon Materials, which contributed supplies for the construction of the garden. </p>

<p class="blog-text1">The Rahway River Association has been invited to provide input on the Rahway River Corridor Study that was recently ordered by the Maplewood Township Committee. The study examines the feasibility of creating a "green" corridor alongside the east branch of the Rahway River which flows through Maplewood. The study was prepared by Edgewater Design LLC and contains comprehensive historical and geological data. It take a while to download but is well worth the wait! Click to download study </p>

<p class="blog-text1">On October 2, 2010, approximately 30 volunteers joined RRA members to pick up over 20 bags of litter from Milton Lake Park in Rahway. The cleanup was sponsored by the RRA and the Rahway High School Social Action Club. Refreshments were provided by Saliga-Markey Real Estate and United Water Rahway. Equipment was provided by the City of Rahway Clean Communities Grant.
Milton Lake Park is part of the Union County park system and is bisected by the Robinson's Branch of the Rahway River. The volunteers were joined by Union County Freeholder Rick Proctor and Rahway Councilmember Samson Steinman, as well as a television crew from News 12 NJ.</p>

<p class="blog-text1">RRA members joined Union County Freeholder Bette Jane Kowalski, Union County Parks personnel and Union County Adopt-a-Park volunteers to begin an ambitious plan to remove invasive plants from the Red Hill section of Ash Brook Reservation in Scotch Plains. Red Hill is unique to Ash Brook and certainly to Union County as it contains a variety of native plants and animals usually found in the New Jersey Pinelands many miles to the south. In 2009 the RRA commissioned an extensive report on Red Hill that outlined plans for combating invasive plants. Click to view report.
We plan our continued removal of non-native plants in 2010 and beyond, so please contact us if you would like to get involved.</p>
